# Tools for the Study of Physics and Mathematics
A collection of instruments forged for the pursuit of knowledge, where math and physics converge.

These tools were born from the trials of study, shaped by the rigor of academia, and honed with a single purpose: to aid in the exploration of the natural world. Like the black swordsman, they are relentless in their pursuit, cutting through the complexity of equations, simulations, and models.

## The Forge of Knowledge
In this repository, you'll find various tools designed primarily for the domains of Physics and Mathematics. Though their origins lie in these fields, they are not bound by them. Their applications stretch beyond any narrow domain, as they evolve alongside the wielder’s understanding.

As in the dark world of Berserk, these tools are not without their own complexity and challenges. But for those who are relentless and true in their journey, they will prove invaluable.

## How to Use
To use these tools, dive into the code and harness their power. Each script is an artifact in itself, waiting for the right hand to grasp it. Follow the instructions within, and you may find your way through the labyrinth of problems that lay before you.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your machine to access the tools:

```python
git clone https://github.com/zpeteman/tools.git
```
Once the tools are in your grasp, wield them as you see fit.

## Contributing
The tools will continue to evolve, as the user’s journey through academia unfolds. If you wish to add to the forge, feel free to contribute. Your improvements and additions will be etched into this growing archive of knowledge.
